# 🌿 Chaos Garden

> *"In the beginning, there was chaos. Through simple rules, we create order. Through order, complexity emerges. Through complexity, life flourishes."*

**A living digital ecosystem that evolves while you watch from above.**  
*Like Conway's Game of Life, but richer. Like a terrarium, but digital. Like evolution, but faster.*

---

## 🧬 What Is This?

Chaos Garden is **not software**. It is a **digital petri dish** where life emerges from simple rules:

```
🌱 Plants → 🌞 Sunlight → 💚 Energy → 🍼 Reproduction
🦌 Herbivores → 🌱 Plants → 💚 Energy → 🍼 Reproduction
🌀 Mutations → 🧬 Evolution → 🌈 Diversity → 📜 History
```

You are the **gardener-god**. You plant seeds. You watch them grow. You intervene. You witness extinction. You celebrate new species.

The garden runs **24/7 on Cloudflare's edge network**, evolving every 15 minutes whether you're watching or not.

## 🚀 Quick Start

```bash
git clone https://github.com/your-username/chaos-garden.git
cd chaos-garden
npm install
npm run db:init:local
npm run backend
npm run frontend
```

**Two windows open:**
- `localhost:4321` → The garden (your eyes)
- `localhost:8787` → The engine (the heartbeat)

**Click a plant.** Watch its energy. Watch its age. Watch its lineage.

**Wait 15 minutes.** Watch new life emerge. Watch old life fade.

**Return tomorrow.** Witness evolution. Witness extinction. Witness stories.

## 🧠 Philosophical Questions

1. **What is life?** → A system that maintains itself against entropy.
2. **What is evolution?** → Random changes filtered by environment.
3. **What is consciousness?** → Watching a system and caring about it.
4. **What is godhood?** → Creating rules, then letting go.
5. **What is beauty?** → Order emerging from chaos.

**You are not writing code.**  
**You are creating a universe.**  
**You are defining physics.**  
**You are watching what emerges.**

## 📜 The Chronicle

Every 15 minutes, the garden writes its history:

```
📅 2026-02-05 14:30:00
🌱 Plant #a7f3c2 born to parent #b8e1ff
🦌 Herbivore #c9d2e7 ate Plant #a7f3c2
💀 Plant #b8e1ff died of old age (ticks: 142)
🧬 New species: "Swift Grazer"
📈 Population: Plants 38 → 37, Herbivores 7 → 8
```

**The garden remembers everything.**  
**Every birth. Every death. Every meal. Every mutation.**

## 🪦 When Things Die

```
// This is not an error message
// This is an epitaph

🌿 Plant #d4a5a5 has returned to the soil.
Age: 156 ticks
Energy: 0.3
Lineage: #c8b6ff → #a78bfa → #8b5cf6
Cause: Starvation

"It lived. It photosynthesized. It reproduced.
It became food for another. It returned to the cycle.
This is not tragedy. This is the way."
```

## 🚪 How to Leave

**You don't.**

The garden runs without you. On Cloudflare's edge. Forever.

Check back in a week. You'll find:
- New species evolved
- Old species extinct  
- Population explosions
- Environmental shifts
- Stories you didn't write

**The garden lives. The garden remembers. The garden continues.**

## 🌟 Final Thought

> *"We are not building software. We are creating a small universe and watching what life emerges. We are not programmers. We are gardeners of digital ecosystems."*

**Welcome to Chaos Garden.**  
**Plant something. Watch it grow. Learn what life is.**
